Minikube is already installed for you. Check that it is properly installed, by running the *minikube version* command:

`minikube version`{{execute}}

OK, we can see that minikube is in place.

To install minikube locally and follow this tutorial on your machine, please refer to this [link](https://k8s-docs.netlify.app/en/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/).

Start the cluster, by running the *minikube start* command:

`minikube start`{{execute}}

Great! You now have a running Kubernetes cluster in your online terminal. Minikube started a virtual machine for you, and a Kubernetes cluster is now running in that VM.
